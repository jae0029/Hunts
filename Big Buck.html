    <h1>Story about the Picture</h1>
    <img src="Big Buck.JPG" alt="Your Image" style="width: 40%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <p>My wife's uncle "Nona" and his family (Charise, Pheobe, and Rawson) visited from Canada. He was interested in going hunting and I was interested in taking him! So we went several times in the morning and afternoon with no luck.
        I was begining to get a little bummed out because i wanted to help him get one while they were here, but i kept my hope because the rut was in full swing and i knew anything could happen. It was about the 10 or 11th time we went to go sit in a plywood blind that i had built years ago.
        It was about 20 minutes before legal light was gone, when a bruiser stepped out about 100 yards away into the field. Mind you, thats not an easy shot to make even to an experienced hunter and Nona was not an experienced hunter... or shooter. In fact, prior to this moment he had only shot a gun one other time in his life.
        I talked him through where to place the crosshairs and how to squeeze the trigger withoiut flinching. He was nervous as anyone would be. This deer was bigger than any deer I've ever seen in person. He expressed to me that he didnt know if he could do it. I offered to take the gun and shoot it in his place, but he decined with a chuckle.
        He eventually calmed down enough to take a good shot. I watched as the deer spun and beelined for the woods with his nose nearly scraping the ground. I could see that he had piled up just inside the tree line about 20 yards from the point of impact. We exited the blind with so much excitement I thought the whole thing would come crashing down! 
        I carefully took the gun from Nona and put the saftey on. As we were approaching the deer he asked if there was any danger in what we were about to do. I replied by saying not really as long as we do it the right way. His eyes kind of got wide and asked if anyone has ever been injured doing this. I replied with, yes there has been people who have died from being gored by deer but that we will be fine!
        We made it to the deer and I checked to make sure he had expired by touching the deer's eye with the gun barrel. Once everything was good. He finally got his hands on him. I couldnt believe it! It was Nona's first deer and his second time firing a gun! But he got it done and i couldnt have been happier with the result. We loaded the deer in the truck and went to go show the whole family what we'd come home with!
